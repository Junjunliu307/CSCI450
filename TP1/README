**Platform**: Ubuntu 16.04 (replace with your version if different)


## How to Run
1. Ensure list.txt (department data) is in the same directory as the code files.
2. Use the command `make all` to compile the program.
3. Use the command `./servermain` to start the server in one terminal.
4. Use the command `./client` to start a client in another terminal.


## What I Have Done in the Assignment
In this assignment, I implemented a client-server architecture where the client requests information related to a department and the server responds with the appropriate data or an error message if the department is not found. The communication between the client and server is established using TCP sockets. The server can handle multiple clients using forked processes to manage concurrent connections.

## Code Files and Their Purpose

1. **client.cpp**:
   - Implements the client-side logic that connects to the server, sends department names, and receives responses regarding department availability. It handles creating sockets, sending queries to the server, and processing server responses.

2. **servermain.cpp**:
   - Implements the server-side logic that accepts connections from clients, processes requests, searches for the requested department in a predefined dataset, and returns the results. It can handle multiple clients concurrently using forking and manages TCP connections.

## Message Format
- The message format for communication between the client and server is as follows:
  - **Client to Server**: The client sends a message in the format of `unique_id:department`, where `unique_id` is generated based on the process ID and `department` is the department name entered by the user.
  - **Server to Client**: The server responds with either the department name found in the database or a "Department Not Found" message, along with relevant campus information.

## Project Idiosyncrasies
- The project may fail under the following conditions:
  - If the server is not running when the client tries to connect, the client will terminate with an error.
  - If the server fails to fork a process for handling a client connection, further client connections might be affected.
  - If the dataset file is missing or improperly formatted, the server won't be able to return correct results.
  
## Reused Code
- No external code was reused for this project. All code was written from scratch.
