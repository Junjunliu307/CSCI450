Assignment: EE450 Project Part 1

Code Files:
1. servermain.cpp: Implements the main server that handles multiple clients using TCP connections.
2. client.cpp: Implements the client that sends department queries to the server using dynamic ports.

How to Run:
1. Ensure list.txt (department data) is in the same directory as the code files.
2. Use the command `make all` to compile the program.
3. Use the command `./servermain` to start the server in one terminal.
4. Use the command `./client` to start a client in another terminal.

Project Functionality:
- The server reads department data from list.txt and listens on a static port.
- Clients connect using dynamic ports and send department queries to the server.
- The server responds with the relevant campus server ID or a "Not found" message.
- Both server and client print logs as required by the project.

Reused Code: 
Some socket programming patterns and code are inspired by Beej's Guide to Network Programming.
